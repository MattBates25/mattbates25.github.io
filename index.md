# Final Project e-Portfolio

Welcome! This site hosts my final project video, artifacts, and a professional self-assessment.

## Professional Self-Assessment
  I have been attending SNHU's Computer Science program since the beginning of 2023. I've had the opportunity to work on numberous projects and with
  countless different technologies and systems. Just working on the three enhancement areas for my Weight Tracking Application has shown what a transformative
  experience it has been. I've moved from knowing nothing about software development or programming to having an appreciation for software engineering principles.
  I've learned that being a successful developer is more than writing code that 'just works.' It means being passionate about delivering products meant for users,
  considering serious ethical questions around your implementations and how your software can be used or interpreted, and it means putting effort into building products
  that are robust, secure, and user centric. I've taken shareholder goals and turned them into concrete designs. Through vulnerability assessments I demonstrated
  the ability to analyze source code for potential security flaws and recommend mitigation strategies aligning with OWASP secure coding standards. I simulated working as
  part of an Agile development team, learning how iterative development, collaboration, and security reviews work together to produce robust software solutions.
  The artifacts in my ePortfolio show that I can design with users in mind, build reliable features, reason about performance, and defend against common failure points.
  The weight tracking application I iterated on over the last seven weeks showcases my ability to work on a full-stack application within a single, cohesive project.
  I implemented modern polished UI/UX design, I implemented strong database principles, I implemented a dynamic sorting feature demonstrating algorithmic trade-offs.

## Artifacts
- [Weight Tracker (Android) – repo](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio)
- [Initial Artifact](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio/tree/v1.0-Initial)
 Matthew’s Weight Tracking Application is an android application written in Java using the Android Studio IDE.
 This artifact features logic for account creation and logging in, navigation between screens utilizing a bottom navigation bar,
 the setting of a weight goal and phone number, and the addition and deletion of weight entries to track their weight in a grid on a screen within the app.
 It was originally written in October 2024 for my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course.
I selected this artifact as it is a showcase of a full-stack application that provides a comprehensive showcase of my abilities in both crafting a functional and feature rich backend and a visually impressive and usable frontend.
 I’m given the opportunity to demonstrate a holistic understanding of what it takes to create a robust, secure, and professional application that offers a practical way to demonstrate my skills.
