# Final Project e-Portfolio

Welcome! This site hosts my final project video, artifacts, and a professional self-assessment.

## Professional Self-Assessment

I have been attending SNHU's Computer Science program since the beginning of 2023. I've had the opportunity to work on numerous projects and with countless different technologies and systems. Working on the three enhancement areas for my Weight Tracking Application has shown me how transformative this experience has been. I started with little knowledge of software development or programming, and now I have a deep appreciation for software engineering principles.

I've learned that being a successful developer is more than writing code that "just works." It means being passionate about delivering products designed for users, considering serious ethical questions around your implementations and how your software can be used or interpreted, and putting effort into building products that are robust, secure, and user-centric. I've taken stakeholder goals and turned them into concrete designs. Through vulnerability assessments, I demonstrated the ability to analyze source code for potential security flaws and recommend mitigation strategies that align with OWASP secure coding standards. I simulated working as part of an Agile development team, learning how iterative development, collaboration, and security reviews work together to produce robust software solutions.

The artifacts in my ePortfolio show that I can design with users in mind, build reliable features, reason about performance, and defend against common failure points. The Weight Tracking Application I iterated on over the last seven weeks showcases my ability to work on a full-stack application within a single, cohesive project. I implemented a modern, polished UI/UX design, strong database principles, and a dynamic sorting feature that demonstrates algorithmic trade-offs.

## Artifacts

- [Weight Tracker (Android) – repo](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio)
- [Matthew's Weight Tracking Application, Initial Artifact](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio/tree/v1.0-Initial)

Matthew’s Weight Tracking Application is an Android application written in Java using the Android Studio IDE. This artifact features logic for account creation and login, navigation between screens using a bottom navigation bar, the setting of a weight goal and phone number, and the addition and deletion of weight entries to track weight in a grid on a screen within the app. It was originally written in October 2024 for my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course.

I selected this artifact because it showcases a full-stack application that provides a comprehensive demonstration of my abilities in both crafting a functional, feature-rich backend and a visually appealing frontend. I’m given the opportunity to demonstrate a holistic understanding of what it takes to create a robust, secure, and professional application that offers a practical way to showcase my skills.

## Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

- [Enhancement1](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio/tree/v1.1-Enhancement1)

The most visible improvement to the application is the complete redesign of all screens. I transitioned from using the original application’s LinearLayouts to a more modern and fluid ConstraintLayout design. I met each of the course outcomes in my enhancement. I built environments that encourage collaboration and a diverse audience by adding comprehensive comments to every class. The complete overhaul taught me how much goes into refactoring a software application with many interconnected classes and files. I thought the bug related to deleting weight entries would be simple, but fixing it required a deep understanding of the application's architecture.

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

- [Enhancement2](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio/tree/v1.2-Enhancement2)

The Weight Tracking Application was improved by implementing a new sorting feature in the ProgressFragment, directly showcasing my skills in leveraging existing, high-performance algorithms. The course outcomes met through this enhancement include the design, development, and delivery of professional-grade visual communications, demonstrated by the implemented spinner that provides algorithmic choices. While working on this enhancement, I learned the value of separating implementations between different layers of an application and that sometimes the best solution involves rethinking how data flows through the system.

## Enhancement Three: Databases

- [Enhancement3](https://github.com/MattBates25/ePortfolio/tree/v1.3-Enhancement3)

I was able to demonstrate an understanding of database performance and foresight for future expansion of the dataset within the app by adding indexes. I knew that the user_id and date were the most important columns for queries and optimized them accordingly. The culmination of changes made in this and other enhancements transformed my database from a simple data store into a robust, professional-grade layer of my application. Adding indexing meets the outcome of evaluating solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards while managing the application’s data. Adding an index and enforcing a foreign key doesn’t result in an immediately noticeable visual change, but it is critical nonetheless. I have learned that a significant portion of professional software engineering happens behind the scenes to ensure stability, scalability, and security.
